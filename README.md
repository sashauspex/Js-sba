# Js-sba

Hi, guys! How is it going? 

I was trying to build that code with unique values of learners but I couldn't solve it. It is a little hard for me to assign two separate arrays into different object within one array. Anyway, I had some efforts and spent time on study other things like switch statement, try and catch, delete element or much deep understanding of forEach(), map(). 

Thank you!
